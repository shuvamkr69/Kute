# Push Notifications for Likes and Super Likes

## Overview
This feature sends push notifications to users when they receive likes or super likes from other users, helping increase engagement and user awareness of incoming interest.

## Implementation Details

### 🎯 **Notification Types Added**

#### 1. **Like Received Notification**
- **Trigger**: When User A likes User B (and it's not a mutual match)
- **Recipient**: User B (the user who was liked)
- **Title**: "💝 Someone likes you!"
- **Message**: "You have a new like! Check your matches to see who it is."
- **Type**: `like_received`
- **Channel**: `likes`

#### 2. **Super Like Received Notification**  
- **Trigger**: When User A super likes User B (and it's not a mutual match)
- **Recipient**: User B (the user who was super liked)
- **Title**: "⭐ You got a Super Like!"
- **Message**: "{Sender Name} super liked you! They're really interested in getting to know you."
- **Type**: `super_like_received`
- **Channel**: `likes`

### 🔧 **Backend Implementation**

#### **Files Modified**:

1. **`backend/src/controllers/liked.controller.js`**
   - Enhanced `UserLiked` function to send like notifications
   - Enhanced `UserSuperLiked` function to send super like notifications

2. **`backend/src/utils/notifications.js`**
   - Added new notification types: `like_received`, `super_like_received`
   - Added `likes` notification channel
   - Enhanced vibration patterns for different notification types

### 📱 **Notification Features**

#### **Vibration Patterns**:
- **Match**: `[0, 500, 300, 500, 300, 700]` (exciting celebration pattern)
- **Message**: `[0, 250, 250, 250]` (standard communication pattern)
- **Super Like**: `[0, 300, 150, 300, 150, 500, 300]` (special attention pattern)
- **Like**: `[0, 200, 100, 200]` (gentle notification pattern)

#### **Channel Management**:
- **match**: For mutual matches
- **message**: For chat messages
- **likes**: For like and super like notifications
- **default**: For general notifications

#### **Data Payload**:
```javascript
// Like Received
{
  type: "like_received",
  fromUserId: "sender_user_id",
  fromUserName: "Sender Name",
  fromUserImage: "sender_avatar_url"
}

// Super Like Received
{
  type: "super_like_received", 
  fromUserId: "sender_user_id",
  fromUserName: "Sender Name",
  fromUserImage: "sender_avatar_url"
}
```

### 🔄 **User Flow Examples**

#### **Scenario 1: User A Likes User B (No Match)**
1. ✅ User A swipes right on User B
2. ✅ System creates Like record with `matched: false`
3. ✅ User B receives push notification: "💝 Someone likes you!"
4. ✅ User B can check "Liked You" screen to see who it was (premium feature)

#### **Scenario 2: User A Super Likes User B (No Match)**
1. ✅ User A super likes User B
2. ✅ System creates Like record with `superLiked: true, matched: false`
3. ✅ User B receives push notification: "⭐ You got a Super Like!" from User A
4. ✅ User B sees clear identity in notification (encourages response)

#### **Scenario 3: User A Likes User B → Mutual Match**
1. ✅ User A likes User B (B already liked A)
2. ✅ System sets both records to `matched: true`
3. ✅ Both users receive match notifications: "🎉 It's a Match!"
4. ✅ No separate like notification sent (match takes precedence)

### 📈 **Business Benefits**

#### **Increased Engagement**:
- Users get immediate feedback when someone is interested
- Reduces time between like and potential response
- Encourages users to return to the app

#### **Premium Feature Support**:
- Like notifications create desire to see who liked them
- Drives premium subscription conversions
- Creates FOMO (fear of missing out) effect

#### **User Experience**:
- Clear communication about incoming interest
- Different notification styles for different actions
- Helps users understand app activity better

### 🛡 **Privacy & UX Considerations**

#### **Like Notifications** (Privacy-Conscious):
- Don't reveal sender identity in notification
- Generic message encourages checking the app
- Maintains mystery while creating engagement

#### **Super Like Notifications** (Identity-Revealing):
- Show sender name (super likes are premium, intentional)
- More personal message to encourage response
- Higher investment from sender justifies identity reveal

#### **Match Notifications** (Full Disclosure):
- Complete transparency for mutual connections
- Both users equally invested
- Clear next step (start chatting)

### 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

1. **Regular Like Test**:
   - User without premium likes another user
   - Verify recipient gets anonymous like notification
   - Verify no match notification if not mutual

2. **Super Like Test**:
   - User uses super like on another user
   - Verify recipient gets personalized super like notification
   - Verify sender identity is revealed

3. **Match Test**:
   - User likes someone who already liked them back
   - Verify both users get match notifications
   - Verify no separate like notification

4. **No Token Test**:
   - Like user who has no push token
   - Verify graceful handling with appropriate logs

### 📋 **Code Implementation**

#### **Like Notification Logic**:
```javascript
// In UserLiked function - when no match detected
const user = await User.findById(userId);
const likedUser = await User.findById(likedUserId);

if (likedUser && likedUser.pushToken) {
  await sendPushNotification(
    likedUser.pushToken,
    "💝 Someone likes you!",
    "You have a new like! Check your matches to see who it is.",
    {
      type: "like_received",
      fromUserId: userId,
      fromUserName: user.fullName,
      fromUserImage: user.avatar1
    }
  );
}
```

#### **Super Like Notification Logic**:
```javascript
// In UserSuperLiked function - when no match detected
if (superLikedUser && superLikedUser.pushToken) {
  await sendPushNotification(
    superLikedUser.pushToken,
    "⭐ You got a Super Like!",
    `${currentUser.fullName} super liked you! They're really interested in getting to know you.`,
    {
      type: "super_like_received",
      fromUserId: currentUser._id,
      fromUserName: currentUser.fullName,
      fromUserImage: currentUser.avatar1
    }
  );
}
```

### 🚀 **Deployment Status**
- ✅ Backend implementation complete
- ✅ Notification utility updated
- ✅ Server running with new code
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Ready for mobile app testing

### 🔮 **Future Enhancements**
1. **Batch Notifications**: Group multiple likes into daily summaries
2. **Smart Timing**: Send notifications based on user's active hours
3. **Notification Preferences**: Allow users to customize notification types
4. **Rich Notifications**: Include sender photos in notification (where allowed)
5. **Analytics**: Track notification open rates and conversion to matches
