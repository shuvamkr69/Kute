# "Liked You" Feature Implementation

## Overview
This feature shows users who have liked the current user but haven't been liked back yet, with premium functionality for blur effects and interaction controls.

## Backend Implementation

### New API Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/users/usersWhoLikedMe`
- **Purpose**: Get users who liked me but I haven't liked back yet
- **Authentication**: Requires JWT token

### Controller Function: `getUsersWhoLikedMe`
- **File**: `backend/src/controllers/liked.controller.js`
- **Logic**: 
  - Finds all `Like` records where `likedUserId` matches current user
  - Filters for `matched: false` (not matched yet)
  - Populates user data from User model
  - Returns formatted user data including super like status

### Response Format
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "user_id",
    "fullName": "User Name",
    "profileImage": "image_url",
    "superLiked": true/false,
    "likedAt": "timestamp"
  }
]
```

## Frontend Implementation

### Modified Component: `src/screens/Likes.tsx`

#### New Tab System
- **Previous**: 2 tabs (Matches, Viewed By)
- **Updated**: 3 tabs (Matches, Liked You, Viewed By)

#### Premium Integration
- **Non-Premium Users**: 
  - See blurred profile images
  - Names shown as "•••••"
  - Call-to-action: "Get Premium to see"
  - Clicking leads to Premium screen

- **Premium Users**:
  - See clear profile images
  - Full names displayed
  - Interactive "Like them back?" button
  - Can match instantly by clicking the button

#### Visual Features
- **Super Like Badge**: Blue star icon for users who super liked
- **Blur Effect**: Uses `expo-blur` for non-premium users
- **Match Animation**: Instant match when premium users like back

### Key Functions Added
1. `fetchLikedMe()` - API call to get users who liked me
2. `renderLikedMeItem()` - Render function for liked me cards
3. Premium check logic for blur effects
4. Instant match functionality for premium users

## User Experience Flow

2. **Frontend Testing**
   - Test tab switching between all three tabs
   - Verify blur effects for non-premium users
   - Test premium user interaction flows
   - Verify match creation and navigation

3. **Integration Testing**
